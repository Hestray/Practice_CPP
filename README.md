This git repository contains a few projects that I have worked on to try to figure out how to [BETTER] code in C++.
# Student_pack
This is a project that encapsulates the following:
1. Enhanced Calculator App (usual, scientific, memory features, error handling)
2. Student Management System (grade, info, reports, statistics, files I/O)
3. Campus Banking System (OOP: auth, logging, security concepts, data validation, etc.)
4. Text Analysis Tool (string manipulation, file handling and the like)
Its main objectives are:
- functions, input handling and err checking with containers
- OOP C++ and its pillars
- RAII, smart pointers and move semantics
# Timer & Budget (Prod_Pack)
1. Timer (to clock in, clock out; calculates difference between times and you can check how much you worked)
2. Budget tracking app
